It draws from his <em>\"Volapük-English Dictionary\"</em> and <em>\"English-Volapük Dictionary\"</em>, both revised in 2010, and his translation of <em>\"Vödabuk Volapüka pro Deutänapükans\"</em> by Arie de Jong (1931), which was revised and completed from 2012–2022 by Cifal Hermann Philipps. It also includes additional examples extracted from sample texts from Volapük Vifik, and readings from volapük.com.<br>The Esperanto translations are based on <em>\"Vortaro Volapük–Esperanto kaj Esperanto–Volapük\"</em> by André Cherpillod."
